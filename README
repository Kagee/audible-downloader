spaces are supported

not click or navigate in it

<download dir>/admhelper if you restart


KNOWN BUGS:

Sometimes lists a unresonable number of pages of books, i.e:
"INFO(#282):Found 47 pages of books" when you expected
"INFO(#282):Found 15 pages of books" 
FIX: Ctrl+x while "INFO(#286):Scrolling to bottom of page because javascript"
and delete admhelper if found in download dir

Download error KeyError: 'content-disposition'
You probably hit "Download limit for untargeted content reached."
FIX: No idea, probably wait 30 min and restart (delete admhelper from
download dir before starting)
