HOWTO download.py: 
(sudo apt-get install python-pip)
pip install requests
pip install selenium
Download and extract the correct ChromeDriver zip file from 
  https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
  to script folder

Default download dir is /tmp/audible, change with -w, unsure if
spaces are supported

You are free to minimize the browser window while downloading, but do
not click or navigate in it

The script supports a lazy format of restart.

IMPORTANT:

We trick Audible to think that we want to download files
using Audible Download Manager. If "software verification"
is on, Audible apparently tries to detect if you have
it installed, and will fail. To get proper downloads,
turn off software verification in your Audible settings.

KNOWN BUGS:

Sometimes lists a unresonable number of pages of books, i.e:
"INFO(#282):Found 47 pages of books" when you expected
"INFO(#282):Found 15 pages of books" 
FIX: Ctrl+x while "INFO(#286):Scrolling to bottom of page because javascript"
and restart

Download error KeyError: 'content-disposition'
You probably hit "Download limit for untargeted content reached."
FIX: This was probably fixed by starting to lie in our
User-Agent. If not, probably wait 30 min and restart

HOWTO loop_remove_drm.sh:
Script for removing drm from all audible *.aax-files in a folder.
Requires a ffmpeg new enough to support -activation_bytes avaliable
Requires exiftool to be installed. 
Mac: "brew install exiftool"
Linux (apt): sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
Configure the variables ACTIVATION_BYTES, FROM, TO and FFMPEG to
fit your system/need before running
You find ACTIVATION_BYTES by using
