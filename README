# (https://github.com/inAudible-NG/audible-activator/blob/master/LICENSE)
#
# HOWTO: 
# (sudo apt-get install python-pip)
# pip install requests
# pip install selenium
# Download and extract the correct ChromeDriver zip file from 
#   https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads
#   to script folder
#
# Default download dir is /tmp/audible, change with -w, unsure if
# spaces are supported
#
# You are free to minimize the browser window while downloading, but do
# not click or navigate in it
# 
# The script supports a lazy format of restart. REMEMBER to delete
# <download dir>/admhelper if you restart
#
#
# KNOWN BUGS:
#
# Sometimes lists a unresonable number of pages of books, i.e:
# "INFO(#282):Found 47 pages of books" when you expected
# "INFO(#282):Found 15 pages of books" 
# FIX: Ctrl+x while "INFO(#286):Scrolling to bottom of page because javascript"
# And delete admhelper is found in download dir
#
# Download error KeyError: 'content-disposition'
# You probably hit "Download limit for untargeted content reached."
# FIX: No idea, probably wait 30 min and restart (delete admhelper from
# download dir before starting)
